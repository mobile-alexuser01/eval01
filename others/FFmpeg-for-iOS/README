This is a demo project for getting FFmpeg functionality into your OpenGLES applications on iOS devices.

Yeah, I realize that this is coming when 4.1 has come out and we now have hardware decoding capabilities, but maybe some people want to use FFmpeg still.

Anyway this is code I've been sitting on for a while that I intended to create a blog tutorial for but never got around to.

You'll need to build FFmpeg, I have included some scripts (stolen from iFrameExtractor by jayparro - http://github.com/jayrparro/iFrameExtractor)

THIS PROJECT DOES NOT USE SDL. NO SDL!

OK I don't really know if this works as is, I can't make any guarantees.  Don't ask me to fix it for you if it doesn't work and it doesn't look like I'm maintaining it.
